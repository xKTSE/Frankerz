/*
	When the backButton is pressed (series of events that follow):

		1. callBackCount is set to 1
		2. functionToCallAfterDBCalls is set
		3. save pet is called
		4. interval is initiated to listen for when the database function call ends

		5. in the waitForCallbackComplete

			1. interval is cleared
			2. callBackCount and callBackCheck are reset
			3. functionToCallAfterDBCalls is called

				1. App.load is called

			4. functionToCallAfterDBCalls is reset

			PROBLEM: functionToCallAfterDBCalls is reset after every line of sequential code in App.load is called but BEFORE the database method in App.load completes and calls App.load's implementation of functionToCallAfterDBCalls. As a result, App.load calls an empty function after DB calls are done
